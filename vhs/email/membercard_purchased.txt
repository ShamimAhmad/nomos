Hey {{fname}} {{lname}},

Thanks for purchasing a VHS Membership card!

Currently, member cards can only be picked up in person. You'll need to arrange for a time to be down at the space with a director and they can issue you your card!

The directors have been notified of your purchase and will be in touch as soon as they can!

Thank you,
- Vancouver Hackspace Society
