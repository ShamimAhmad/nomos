Hey {{fname}} {{lname}},
<br />
<p>Thanks for purchasing a VHS Membership card!</p>
<p>Currently, member cards can only be picked up in person. You'll need to arrange for a time to be down at the space with a director and they can issue you your card!</p>
<p>The directors have been notified of your purchase and will be in touch as soon as they can!</p>
</br>
Thank you,
<br />
